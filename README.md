# HTOS
The first PHP, HTML5 and JavaScript based "Operating Sytem" for webservers

# The first time a webserver is more than a webserver
Apart from being a second space HTOS has a couple of handy features for managing your webserver like:
- Text editor / Notes
- FileManager with zip/tar tool
- Python3 interpreter
- And much more...

HTOS also has a couple of handy daily use tools like:
- Calculator
- Notes
- Simple webbrowser
- Weather forecast
- And much more...

HTOS is also expandable in the future with powerfull webapps made in HTML5, JavaScript or PHP

# Until now we only had operating systems for hosting a webserver, not operating systems which run on a webserver
