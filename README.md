# HTOS
The first PHP, HTML5 and JavaScript based "Operating Sytem" for low spec computers(Raspberry pi, grandma pc, cheap laptop, etc) and for managing your webserver

# The first time a low spec computer is faster than the newest desktop.
Apart from being a really light and capable operating system, HTOS has a couple of handy features for managing your webserver like:
- Text editor / Notes
- FileManager with zip/tar tool
- Python3 interpreter(Beta + broken)
- And much more...

HTOS also has a couple of handy daily use tools like:
- Calculator
- Notes
- Simple webbrowser
- And much more...

HTOS is also expandable with applications made in HTML5, JavaScript, PHP and possibly Python3 in the future too.

# Until now we only had operating systems for hosting a webserver, not operating systems which run on a webserver

[Demo](http://htos-demo.epizy.com/htos) This demo is outdated and a bad representation of the current HTOS, we'll update the demo when we release the pre-alpha sourcecode of HTOS
